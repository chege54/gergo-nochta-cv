Gergő,Nochta,,Budapest,,Software Engineer | Automated Driving,"I have over 9 years of experience in automotive embedded software development using C and C++. My expertise spans the full software development lifecycle - from requirement analysis and software design to implementation, debugging, and profiling - on various real-time embedded platforms (such as ARM Cortex, Infineon, and TI DSP MCUs).  I have strong proficiency in modern C++ (C++11/14/17), the STL, and in applying data structures, algorithms. I regularly use Python for task automation, test framework development, and tool scripting (e.g., for CI/CD pipelines or log parsing).  I have worked in both bare-metal and RTOS-based environments, and I am slightly experienced with AUTOSAR.  I am familiar with MISRA C/C++, unit testing (GoogleTest), and static/dynamic analysis tools (e.g., Valgrind, Bloaty). I also have practical experience in version control systems (Git), continuous integration (Jenkins, Github actions), and issue tracking tools (e.g., Jira).  In addition to software development, I’m deeply interested in Cybersecurity, as well as hands-on technical hobbies such as 3D printing, laser engraving, CAD modeling, and electronics (including PCB design and DIY projects).  I fell I am a proactive problem solver, comfortable working in agile development environments, and enjoy tackling performance bottlenecks, debugging hard-to-reproduce issues, and continuously improving software quality.",Software Development,1116,"Budapest, Budapest, Hungary",,[PERSONAL:https://chege54.github.io/gergo-nochta-cv/],
